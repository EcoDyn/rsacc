Development notes for thr rsacc package

The purpose of the package is to perform accuracy assessment of remote sensing classifications.

The two inputs necessary are a classification, and a set of validation data.

- Both the classification and the validation data can come in two flavours: a raster or a vector

- While vector classifications will always be polygons, vector validatiuon data can be polygons or points

The most common expected combination is raster classification and vector validation, so this will be developed first.

What do we need in terms of algorithm:

1) Input
- Read in classification
    - Is it vector or raster?
    - What is the projection?

- Read in validation
    - Is it vector or raster?
    - Is it point or polygon?
    - What is the projection?

2) Data prep
    - Does the data need to be reprojected?
        - Yes: reproject the validation, as it should usually be lighter
    - If raster x raster, does it need to be resampled to match?
    - MAIN ISSUE: dealing with class labels. Rasters use numbers, vectors can use either numbers or names

3) Extraction of confusion matrix (classification x reference)
    - Extraction for raster x raster
    - Extraction for raster x points
    - Extraction for raster x polygons
    - Extraction for polygons x points
    - Extraction for polygons x polygons

    VALIDATION SCENARIOS:
    - Single vector with all classes labelled by numbers
    - Single vector with all classes labeleed by strings
    - One vector per each class, including labels
    - One vector per class, filename is the label

4) Assessment
    - Measures of agreement
        - Percent accuracy (overall and per class)
        - Omission and Comission (per class)
        - Kappa
        - Kappa inferences
        - Pontius

5) Outputs
    - Console report
    - TXT report
    - CSV with confusion matrix
    - Graphical output?
