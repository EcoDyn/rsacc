Title: Accuracy Assessment for Remote Sensing Classification
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Thiago Sanna Freire Silva
Maintainer: Thiago Sanna Freire Silva <thiago.sf.silva@unesp.br>
Description: This package provides function for computing confusion matrices
and calculating common classification accuracy metrics used to evaluate the
results of land cover classification using remote sensing images.
    Although several packages in R implement similar metrics, what differentiates
this package is the provision of a framework based on exptected land cover
classification data formats and input types (rasters, vector polygons, vector points),
with automated detection of input type and calculation of accuracy metrics accordingly.
